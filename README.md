# Setup of the website
1. Prepare the examplesite and add the hugo.exe as in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZ1Hj5yQ-8&t=119s)
5. In the root folder (where content, layouts,... folders are) run ``.\hugo -D``
6. In the root folder run ``.\hugo server`` to see the website locally on the localhost
7. See also this [clickup info](https://app.clickup.com/20409459/v/dc/kev3k-8322/kev3k-2122)
8. Modify what you want but not the content of the "public" folder
9. After ``.\hugo -D`` move the content of the "public" folder to the root folder of the Github repository where you want to host the website (https://github.com/vschwerdt/web_weeding)

NOTE: everytime you do ``.\hugo -D`` the folder "public" is overwritten so if there are some things that are not being properly deleted you can just delete the folder and run the command again to have a clean state.
