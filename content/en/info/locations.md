# City Hall wedding
Rathaus Rentamt  
Rossmarkt 1  
37339 Leinefelde-Worbis (Worbis)  
[Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/J542HEADssnv9eYB8)

# How to get to the City Hall?
If you stay in Worbis: You can probably walk there. Everything is close to each other.   
It will probably take 10-15 minutes.  
If you stay in Wintzingerode you can get there by car (5 minutes) or ask us...actually ask Vanessa because Jaime is probably as lost as you are xD   
There are probably more people coming so we could organize a carsharing.

# Polterabend post wedding
Dorfgemeinschaftshaus  
Am MÃ¼hlenberg 19   
37339 Wintzingerode  
[Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/6xoZG7k2tsBP8eth9)  

# How to get to the Polterabend?  
Go to Wintzingerode by car/carsharing.  
If you want to feel how it was like to be a young Vanessa, you can also walk.   
It will seem faster on the way back, depending on how much you can drink.  
If you are already staying in Wintzingerode - great. Just follow the noise and you will be there.
