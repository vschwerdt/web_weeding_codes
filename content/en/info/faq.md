# What to wear? :dress:
Dresscode for the Cityhall is formal. We'd recommend dresses for women and suits for men.   
Polterabend is going to be informal. We recommend to bring a jacket, as it might get a bit chilly in the evening.

# Where to fly to? :flight_departure:
Leipzig Airport (LEJ) is the closest airport. From there you can get to Wintzingerode/Worbis by car.   
It's also possible to take a plane to Frankfurt (FRA) and then catch a train to Göttingen. From there you can rent a car or we could organize a pick up for you.   
Either way, for the rest of the stay we would recommend to have a car, because public transport is not very well developed in this area.

# What is the weather like? :sunny:
Around 20°C during the day, around 15°C at night. We recommend to bring a light jacket, as the Polterabend is going to take place outside.

# What can I do in Wintzingerode/Worbis? :mountain:
Enjoy Nature! There are a lot of hiking trails in the area. You can visit Castle Bodenstein, go to the animal park in Worbis or visit Göttingen (if you want to visit a bigger city by car).
