# What to wear?
Dresscode for the Cityhall is formal. We'd recommend dresses for women and suits for men. Polterabend is going to be informal. We recommend to bring a jacket, as it might get a bit chilly in the evening.
# Where to fly to?
Leipzig Airport (LEJ) is the closest airport. From there you can get to Wintzingerode/Worbis by car. It's also possible to take a plane to Frankfurt (FRA) and then catch a train to Göttingen. From there you can rent a car or we could organize a pick up for you. Either way, for the rest of the stay we would recommend to have a car, because public transport is not very well developed in this area.
# What is the weather like?
Around 20°C during the day, around 15°C at night. We recommend to bring a light jacket, as the Polterabend is going to take place outside.
# What can I do in Wintzingerode/Worbis?
Enjoy Nature! There are a lot of hiking trails in the area. You can visit Castle Bodenstein, go to the animal park in Worbis
